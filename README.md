# AAATransformer
You like using Azeroth Auction Assassin? But all your favorite items are in a TSM group? Then this is the solution. You can paste your TSM group string here and it will give you the items JSON for monitoring in AAA.
You can choose the discount and the price source for calculation of the price limit to receive your notifications.

AAATransformer is a simple addon that taps into pricing data from different addons to provide the price limits for the AAA items JSON for sniping monitoring. At least one of the dependent addons must be installed for it to function properly. Open its configuration pane with '/aaat' to adjust the pricing methodology used. It is also displayed within the AddonCompartmentFrame added in the retail version of the game.

To calculate your limits, simply open the addon pane, paste your TSM group string and hit `Tranform`.Â The JSON for AAA will be displayed immediately.

## Supported price sources

- TradeSkillMaster
- Oribos Exchange
- Auctionator
